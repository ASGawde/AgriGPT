Irrigation methods \u2013 what works best  \n\n#### \u2022 Drip (low\u2011flow tubing)  \n- Gives water right to the root zone.  \n- Best for **sandy** or **sloping** fields.  \n- Space emitters 30\u201145\u202fcm apart, 15\u201120\u202fcm deep.  \n- Run 2\u20114\u202fhours per session, depending on flow rate.\n\n#### \u2022 Sprinkler (center\u2011pivot or lateral)  \n- Good for **flat loam or clay** fields.  \n- Use **low\u2011pressure** (30\u201140\u202fkPa) to avoid runoff.  \n- Overlap heads 10\u201115\u202f% for uniform coverage.  \n- Water early morning (5\u20118\u202fam) to reduce evaporation.\n\n#### \u2022 Flood (furrow)  \n- Only for **heavy clay soils** that hold water.  \n- Level the field well; avoid deep furrows that cause water loss.  \n- Flood until water stands",
    "response": "**Corn Leaf Spot vs. Potassium Deficiency**  \n\n**Most likely problem**  \n- Northern or Southern corn leaf blight (fungus) \u2013 brown, cigar\u2011shaped or irregular patches.  \n- Potassium (K) deficiency \u2013 brown, scorched tips on older leaves, poor ear fill.  \n\n**How to tell the difference**  \n\n| Symptom | Leaf blight (fungus) | K\u2011deficiency |\n|--------|----------------------|--------------|\n| Leaf spots | Dark brown, elongated lesions with tan margin; gray center | Uniform brown/bronze tip scorch; no distinct spots |\n| Pattern | Starts on lower leaves, moves upward; lesions may merge | Begins at leaf margins, spreads inward |\n| Yield impact | Stunted plants, shriveled kernels | Small, thin ears; poor grain fill |\n| Water relation | Poor drainage or uneven irrigation favors fungus | Uneven water reduces K uptake, makes scorch clearer |\n\n*Clear lesions \u2192 fungus. Whole tip burnt \u2192 check soil K.*  \n\n**Organic control options**  \n- Neem oil (5\u202f% EM) spray every 7\u201310\u202fdays.  \n- Copper\u2011based fungicide (e.g., copper oxychloride 2\u202f% WP) at label rate, apply early.  \n- Biocontrol agents (e.g., *Trichoderma* spp.) as seed or foliar treatment.  \n\n**Yield expectations**  \n- India: 3\u20137\u202ft\u202f/\u202fha (average 4\u20135\u202ft\u202f/\u202fha rain\u2011fed, up to 7\u202ft\u202f/\u202fha with irrigation).  \n- World average: 5\u201310\u202ft\u202f/\u202fha (high\u2011input farms reach 12\u202ft\u202f/\u202fha).  \n\nIf you harvest <\u202f3\u202ft\u202f/\u202fha, something is limiting the crop.  \n\n**Common causes of low maize yield**  \n\n- Soil quality: low organic matter, N\u2011P\u2011K shortages.  \n- Fertilizer gaps: wrong type, timing, or amount.  \n- Water stress: dry spots or waterlogging.  \n- Pests/diseases: leaf blight, armyworms, etc.  \n- Poor seed/variety choice.",
